Little CMS for D
================

This repository contains bindings for the C based
[Little CMS](https://www.littlecms.com/) library. The bindings have been mostly
generated using [DStep](https://github.com/jacob-carlborg/dstep).

There are also pre-compiled binaries included for Windows, Linux and macOS,
so that building works out of the box.
